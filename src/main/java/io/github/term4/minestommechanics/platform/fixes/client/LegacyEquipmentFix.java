/**
 * Equipment-slot fix: strips empty (AIR) slots from outgoing {@code EntityEquipmentPacket}s, matching vanilla (which only sends
 * slots that actually hold an item - {@code ServerEntity} skips empty ones).
 *
 * <p><b>Why:</b> Minestom's {@code getEquipmentsPacket} sends every {@code EquipmentSlot} including {@code BODY} as AIR for a
 * player. ViaBackwards ({@code v1_20_5to1_20_3}) remaps the BODY slot (6) onto the CHESTPLATE slot (4) - correct for horse/wolf
 * body armor on old clients - so the player's stray {@code BODY=AIR} becomes a second chestplate-slot entry that's empty. The
 * client applies the two slot-4 entries in order (last wins); Minestom's {@code Map.copyOf} randomises that order per JVM run, so
 * the real chestplate intermittently gets overwritten by the AIR and renders invisible. Dropping the empty slots removes the stray
 * BODY entry, so nothing collides.
 *
 * <p>Applied to ALL clients (not gated on {@code isLegacy}): dropping empty slots is what vanilla does, so it's harmless for a
 * modern client, and gating on the legacy check leaked through the join window (the equipment of existing players is sent to a
 * just-joined viewer before its protocol is resolved). A single-slot AIR update (clearing a slot) is left untouched. Hooked from
 * {@link io.github.term4.minestommechanics.platform.player.OptimizedPlayer#sendPacket}.
 *
 * <p><b>Temporary:</b> this is the server-side workaround. The proper fix patches Minestom's {@code getEquipmentsPacket} to
 * skip empty slots like vanilla (upstream branch {@code fix/skip-empty-equipment-slots}); once that is merged and on the
 * pinned Minestom dependency, this fix can be removed.
